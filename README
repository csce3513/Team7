The game is about a panda trying to beat some other enemies. 
Our game is written in C#. We used Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 as our IDE and XNA as our framework. 

Game Playing Instructions:
Once you start the game, press new game. 
Game will start. You can use WASD to move up, left, down or right. 
You can also use the arrow keys to navigate through the game. 
You kill your enemies by jumping on them, just like a mario game. 
There is a jet-pack attached to the back of panda. To use it, hit space bar.
Jet-pack will run out of fuel in about 5 seconds. Use it wisely. 
When there is an obstacle, you can either jump over it using the up arrow key, 
or you can use your jet-pack to fly over it. 
During game, you will also see some pill bottles. 
Those will put the panda in the dub-step mode. 
Game will be more fun in this mode. (Make sure to turn up the volume). 
Anytime during the game, you can hit esc button to pause the game or quit the game. 
Once you quit it, you won't be able to resume it, so make sure you know what you are doing. 
Game will come to an end once you kill all the pandas and move up in the level.
